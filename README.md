# Azure DevOps â€“ Automated Voting Application CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** setup using **Azure DevOps** for a distributed, containerized voting application.  
The application enables users to vote between two options and view real-time results, integrating multiple microservices built with **Python**, **.NET**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Node.js**.  
It implements industry-grade DevOps practices with automation, scalability, and cloud-native deployment through **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

## Architecture
The solution consists of the following components:
- **Front-End (Python):** Web interface for users to vote.
- **Redis:** Collects and caches incoming votes.
- **Worker (.NET):** Processes votes and stores them in the database.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):** Persistent data layer backed by Docker volumes.
- **Results App (Node.js):** Displays live voting results.

All services are containerized via **Docker** and orchestrated through **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

## Key Features
- **Automated CI pipeline** using Azure DevOps for building, testing, and integrating services.
- **Automated CD pipeline** deploying containers to AKS with VM Scale Sets.
- **Containerized microservices** ensuring environmental consistency.
- **Scalable and reliable** deployment using cloud-native infrastructure.
- **Real-time processing** of votes through Redis and .NET worker service.

## Pipeline Workflow

### Continuous Integration (CI)
1. **Code Commit:** Developers push changes to Azure Repos.
2. **Build Trigger:** Azure DevOps pipeline builds each service.
3. **Testing:** Automated unit and integration tests executed.
4. **Image Build:** Docker images created and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
1. **Deployment:** Updated images deployed to AKS.
2. **Scaling:** VM Scale Sets handle horizontal scaling.
3. **Validation:** Application monitored and verified post-deployment.
